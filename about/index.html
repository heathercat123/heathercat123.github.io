		<h3>In brief</h3>
		<p id="about">
			Hi! I'm Heathercat, also known (wait no I'm not very well known in general...) as Heathercat123,
			Though name isn't Heather, and it never has been.
			Old username named after a cat plush, y'know?
			My favorite aesthethic is Frutiger Aero, even though this website doesn't quite demonstrate it well.
			My biggest passion is technology, and it has been ever since 2021.
		</p>

		<h3>Get ready for a backstory</h3>
		<p>
			I've been on the internet since a while now, ever since I discovered about a thing called 'Scratch' back in 2020.
			I made my account, a year later, in 2021.
			I also made my first VM that same year just a few months earlier.
			It ran Windows 7 x86 because I didn't know I could just enable VT-x in the BIOS.
			Heck, I didn't even know what was a BIOS back then!
			I've played around, customised and probably also installed malware on that VM
			so much that it took all of my hard drive space, so I had to delete it.
			Rest in peace, Windows 7...
			... but it started my interest into technology, and that never died.
			Also, I made a new one a while after and deleted it again.
			That's what I call never re-installing Windows on your host computer.
		</p>

		<h3>The downgrade</h3>
		<p>
			Near the end of 2022, I was given a worse computer.
			It was a laptop from 2007, running Windows Vista x86 despite having an x64 processor.
			Of course, I haven't acquired it to use it as my main PC.
			It was my 'test PC' where I did all of my, well, screwing up Windows.
		</p>

		<h3>The new computer</h3>
		<p>
			In 2023, I got a better computer (yay!).
			It was from 2019 (nay!).
			At least it was better than my old 2010 machine (yay again!).
			Its 1TB HDD allowed me to store my older PC's hard drive four times!
			And guess what.
			VT-x was enabled in the UEFI!
			That meant that I could run up to Windows 11 in a VM- no.
			The machine had 4GB of ram.
			And I still use this machine as my main computer.
			AND IT STILL HAS 4GB OF RAM!
		</p>

		<h3>The downgrade deluxe edition</h3>
		<p>
			Fast forward to literally a year later, I got a worse computer... again.
			But this time, it was a 2010 laptop. It was of course another 'test computer'.
		</p>
